# FHSA - FoundersHub Space Administration

[FoundersHub](http://foundershub.co.uk) are taking on a mission to space. The mission is simple, get Brian the Robot into space, film it and get him back down safely. This is a 4 week program for kids 7-14. More details on the [live site](http://fhsa.org.uk)

## Working together

This is a non-profit project, any help in creating a great experience is appreciated. Pull requests are very much welcomed. We would love other groups to do what we are doing, this can only be acheived by having a site which allows us to share what we are doing. Things we would like on the site:
* News/blog - a way to update the world after each of our sessions
* Improved design - this is simply a bastardization of Bootstrap, it would be great if it had a bit more going on and was more appealing to kids
* More stuff - it would be great if this site became a free reource for other groups around the country/world
